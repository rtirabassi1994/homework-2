# homework-2

In this second Homework assignment, I started applying what I learned about Bootstrap to the first version of my portfolio. I included a nav bar with links to an "About Me" page, "Portfolio" Page, and a "Contact" Page. I placed my bio, contact form, and future portfolio examples in a jumbotron and use columns/rows to format. I also included a footer on every page with links to my social media accounts.
